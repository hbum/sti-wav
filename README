sti.py : Speech Transmission Index (STI) from speech waveforms

Overview
--------
	sti.py provides a library of functions used to calculate the speech
	transmission index (STI) from real speech waveforms. The speech trans-
	mission index provides an index measure of speech intelligibility, useful
	for evaluating transmission channel or codec suitability to carrying speech
	audio. The method used by sti.py was described first by Payton and Braida
	in 1999, and is an adaptation of the original STI method developed by
	Houtgast and Steeneken in 1985. Refer to those publications for further
	technical information on the index itself or the calculation approach.

SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
---------------------
    matplotlib
    Numpy
    Scipy, release version 0.8 or greater

INSTALLATION
------------
    No installation is required OR AVAILABLE at this time. The only method of 
    running the program currently is by placing the 'sti.py' file into a python
    project's source directory or including it in your module search path.

Usage
-----
	sti.py provides library functions for calculating the speech transmission
	index. At this time no command line interface or GUI utility is available
	for accessing the functions. See the 'test.py' script contained in the
	source code directory for a brief example of calculating the STI from
	original and distorted raw audio samples.
